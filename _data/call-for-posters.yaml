  We invite researchers and practitioners to submit their work to the <strong>Augmented Humans Poster Track</strong>. Posters provide the opportunity for researchers to get feedback on early-stage work. Posters will be presented in an in-person poster session where author(s) stand by their poster and speak with conference attendees.

topics-title: Topics
topics: |
  Work that is suited for the poster track includes but is not limited to preliminary results, new interactions or experiences that have not been fully tested but show great potential, summaries of small-scale research. Please also refer to the <a href="/">suggested topics</a>.

submissions-title: Submissions
submissions: |
  Submissions should be up to 4 pages long in the single column submission format not including references (see <a href="/calls-for-participation">Calls for Participation</a> for the template). Submissions are <strong>anonymous</strong>. Please remove names and affiliations from the PDF, as well as supplementary materials. 

presentation-title: Presentation and Format
presentation: |
  Posters will be presented in person during the conference’s poster session; at least one author will have to bring their poster when they travel to Melbourne (please contact the poster chairs if you foresee any troubles with traveling to Melbourne). 
  Authors will be assigned a time and location to present their poster to AHs 2024 attendees. The poster boards are 1.2m (W) x 1.8m (H), therefore the posters are preferred to be in A0-size and in portrait mode. This is not compulsory as long as the poster fits within the size of the board.
  Posters should include the title, authors’ names and affiliations, and a concise overview of the research. Posters might also include QR codes to link to online materials (e.g., scenario videos, interactive prototypes). At least one author must be in attendance to present the poster.

reviewing-title: Reviewing and Selection
reviewing: |
  Each poster submission will be reviewed in a double-blind process based on the relevance to the conference and the potential to provoke discussion.
