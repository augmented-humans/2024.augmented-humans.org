  <h3 style="color:#003865;">Behavior and Physiology-Aware Security User Interfaces</h3>
  <strong>Abstract:</strong> Over the past years a global and highly professional cybercrime industry has established itself, making user-centred attacks an omnipresent threat for society. Companies, organisations, and individuals struggle to keep up and protect themselves effectively from an ever-growing number of sophisticated attack vectors. Reasons are, among others, a general lack of awareness and understanding of such threats, inherently complex and difficult-to-understand security and privacy mechanisms, and users struggling to habituate secure behavior in cyber space. Yet, humans are not as helpless as it seems, as many examples of secure behavior in the real world demonstrate. We naturally lock doors, we place valuables in safes or lockers, and we take small detour at night rather than walking through dark areas and parks. Based on examples from our research, I will demonstrate how such natural behavior can be supported in the digital world through the design and development of security user interfaces that are aware of human behavior and physiology. I will showcase how technologies for human augmentation allow a detailed understanding on humans‚Äô responses to security-related situations to be obtained and leveraged so as to target opportune moments, enable contextualised means for protection, and increase users‚Äô security literacy.

  <strong>Florian Alt</strong>
  <strong>Short Bio:</strong> Florian Alt is a full professor of Usable Security and Privacy at the Research Institute for Cyber Defence (CODE) in Munich. In his work, he is interested in designing secure and privacy-preserving systems that naturally blend with the way in which users interact with computing devices. Florian‚Äôs research focuses on investigating users‚Äô behavior in security contexts, on creating and enhancing security and privacy mechanisms based on users‚Äô behavior and physiology, and on understanding as well as mitigating threats emerging from novel ubiquitous technologies. Specific areas of application are Mixed Reality, Smart Homes, and Social Engineering. Florian holds a diploma in Media Informatics from LMU Munich and a Ph.D. in Human-Computer Interaction from the University of Stuttgart.

#   Title: Augmenting human animal communication
#   image: /img/keynote-speaker/thad_starner_0.png
#   Abstract: Animals perceive much more than they can communicate with humans. For example, service dogs can sense when their handlers are about to fall victim to insulin shock. Bomb sniffing dogs can tell the difference between c4 and a peroxide bomb. Pods of dolphins have complex social structures and even refer to each other by name. Over the past decade, we have investigated how to use computer interfaces to help bridge the gap between animal and human communication. In this talk we will discuss some of the more practical use cases for what we have discovered.
#   Biography: Thad Starner is a Professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology's School of Interactive Computing. Thad was perhaps the first to integrate a wearable computer into his everyday life as an intelligent personal assistant. Starner's work as a PhD student would help found the field of Wearable Computing.

#   Biography: Pattie Maes is a professor in MIT's Program in Media Arts and Sciences and until recently served as academic head. She runs the Media  Lab's Fluid Interfaces research group, which aims to radically reinvent the human-machine experience. Coming from a background in artificial intelligence and human-computer interaction, she is particularly interested in the topic of cognitive enhancement, or how immersive and wearable systems can actively assist people with memory, attention, learning, decision making, communication, and wellbeing.
