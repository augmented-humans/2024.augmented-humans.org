  Augmented Humans is thrilled to offer the first mentorship program as part of the conference. 
  Speed mentoring will be held on 13th March (Monday) and will be in person. This will be a one-on-one session from 16:30 until 17:30. This event is designed to encourage broader interaction between senior and junior researchers where the senior researchers act as mentors. Junior researchers are the mentees and can meet mentors to ask questions. We invite interested mentees and mentors to register to participate in speed mentoring.
  <h3>What is “Speed Mentoring” and how does this work?</h3>
  A mentoring session is an opportunity to network and has discussions in a wide variety of dimensions. Everyone is invited to sign up as a mentor, mentee, or both. The signed-up participants are then grouped based on interest and background. 
  For this mentoring session, we will have preassigned groups of 3 participants into various tables comprising mentors and mentees. Each participant will have 10 minutes to talk about a topic of their choice and we will then rotate the turns. A list of example topics for discussion can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/168XOkgd7pRysWXzWUY-Y1qz6UaMfm5uNsUYrl_2DzgQ/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.
  You will be notified about your group and table number on the day of the conference. 
  <strong>The deadline for registration is 1pm (Monday, 13th March).</strong>
